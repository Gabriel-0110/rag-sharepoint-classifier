Happy new year! Gusto’s here to make sure you have what you need for the upcoming tax season.

contributions to Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance under Section 125 plans, or

Notice to Employee
Do you have to file? Refer to the Form 1040 instructions to
determine if you are required to file a tax return. Even if you don’t have to file a tax return, you may be eligible for a refund if box 2 shows an amount or if you are eligible for any credit.
Earned income credit (EIC). You may be able to take the EIC
for 2023 if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than a certain amount. The amount of the credit is based on income and family size. Workers without children could qualify for a smaller credit. You and any qualifying children must have valid social security numbers (SSNs). You can’t take the EIC if your investment income is more than the specified amount for 2023 or if income is earned for services provided while you were an inmate at a penal institution. For 2023 income limits and more information, visit www.irs.gov/EITC. See also Pub. 596. Any EIC that is more than your tax liability is refunded to you, but only if you file a tax return.
Employee’s social security number (SSN). For your
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your SSN. However, your employer has reported your complete SSN to the IRS and the Social Security Administration (SSA).
Clergy and religious workers. If you aren’t subject to social
security and Medicare taxes, see Pub. 517.Corrections. If your name, SSN, or address is incorrect, correct Copies B, C, and 2 and ask your employer to correct your employment record. Be sure to ask the employer to file Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the SSA to correct any name, SSN, or money amount error reported to the SSA on Form W-2. Be sure to get your copies of Form W-2c from your employer for all corrections made so you may file them with your tax return. If your name and SSN are correct but aren’t the same as shown on your social security card, you should ask for a new card that displays your correct name at any SSA office or by calling 800-772-1213. You may also visit the SSA website at www.SSA.gov.
Cost of employer-sponsored health coverage (if such cost is
provided by the employer). The reporting in box 12, using code DD, of the cost of employer-sponsored health coverage is for your information only. The amount reported with code DD is not taxable.
Credit for excess taxes. If you had more than one employer in
2023 and more than $9,932.40 in social security and/or Tier 1 railroad retirement (RRTA) taxes were withheld, you may be able to claim a credit for the excess against your federal income tax. See the Form 1040 instructions. If you had more than one railroad employer and more than $5,821.20 in Tier 2 RRTA tax was withheld, you may be able to claim a refund on Form 843. See the Instructions for Form 843.

Instructions for Employee
(See also Notice to Employee on the back of Copy B.)
Box 1. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax return. Box 2. Enter this amount on the federal income tax withheld line of your
tax return.
Box 5. You may be required to report this amount on Form 8959. See
the Form 1040 instructions to determine if you are required to complete Form 8959.
Box 6. This amount includes the 1.45% Medicare tax withheld on all
Medicare wages and tips shown in box 5, as well as the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on any of those Medicare wages and tips above $200,000.
Box 8. This amount is not included in box 1, 3, 5, or 7. For information
on how to report tips on your tax return, see the Form 1040 instructions.
You must file Form 4137 with your income tax return to report at least
the allocated tip amount unless you can prove with adequate records that you received a smaller amount. If you have records that show the actual amount of tips you received, report that amount even if it is more or less than the allocated tips. Use Form 4137 to figure the social security and Medicare tax owed on tips you didn’t report to your employer. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax return. By filing Form 4137, your social security tips will be credited to your social security record (used to figure your benefits).
Box 10. This amount includes the total dependent care benefits that
your employer paid to you or incurred on your behalf (including  amounts
from a section 125 (cafeteria) plan). Any amount over your employer’s
plan limit is also included in box 1. See Form 2441.
Box 11. This amount is (a) reported in box 1 if it is a distribution  made to
you from a nonqualified deferred compensation or nongovernmental
section 457(b) plan, or (b) included in box 3 and/or box 5 if it is a prior year deferral under a nonqualified or section 457(b) plan that became taxable for social security and Medicare taxes this year because there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture of your right to the deferred amount. This box shouldn’t be used if you had a deferral and a distribution in the same calendar year. If you made a deferral andreceived a distribution in the same calendar year, and you are or will be age 62 by the end of the calendar year, your employer should file Form SSA-131, Employer Report of Special Wage Payments, with the Social Security Administration and give you a copy.
Box 12. The following list explains the codes shown in box 12. You may
need this information to complete your tax return. Elective deferrals (codes D, E, F, and S) and designated Roth contributions (codes AA, BB, and EE) under all plans are generally limited to a total of $22,500 ($15,500 if you only have SIMPLE plans; $25,500 for section 403(b) plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule explained in Pub. 571). Deferrals under code G are limited to $22,500. Deferrals under code H are limited to $7,000.
However, if you were at least age 50 in 2023, your employer may have
allowed an additional deferral of up to $7,500 ($3,500 for section  401(k)(11) and 408(p) SIMPLE plans). This additional deferral amount is not subject to the overall limit on elective deferrals. For code G, the limit on elective deferrals may be higher for the last 3 years before you reach retirement age. Contact your plan administrator for more information. Amounts in excess of the overall elective deferral limit must be included in income. See the Form 1040 instructions.
Note: If a year follows code D through H, S, Y, AA, BB, or EE, you made
a make-up pension contribution for a prior year(s) when you were in military service. To figure whether you made excess deferrals, consider these amounts for the year shown, not the current year. If no year is shown, the contributions are for the current year.
