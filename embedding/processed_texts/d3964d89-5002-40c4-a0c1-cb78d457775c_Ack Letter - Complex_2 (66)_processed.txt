Control Number: NRC2025069741
Dear ALEXANDER ARANDIA:
We received your request for information relating to ANA MORAN GARCIA on February 11, 2025.
Your request is being handled under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552). It
has been assigned the following control number: NRC2025069741.  Please cite this number in all future
correspondence about your request.
We respond to requests on a first-in, first-out basis and on a multi-track system. Your request has been
placed in the complex track. You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to a specific document.
To do so, please send a written request, identifying the specific document sought, to the address above.
We will notify you if your request meets the eligibility requirements for the simple track.
Consistent with 6 C.F.R. § 5.5(a) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) FOIA regulations,
USCIS processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although USCIS’ goal is to respond
within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10 business day extension of this
time period in certain circumstances. Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this
office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Additionally, due to the scope and
nature of your request, USCIS will need to locate, compile, and review responsive records from multiple
offices, both at headquarters and in the field. USCIS may also need to consult with another agency or
other component of the Department of Homeland Security that have a substantial interest in the
responsive information. Due to these unusual circumstances, USCIS will invoke a 10 business day
extension for your request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B). Please contact our office if you would like
to limit the scope of your request or to agree on a different timetable for the processing of your request.
We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.
Agreement to Pay Fees
In accordance with Department of Homeland Security Regulations (6 C.F.R. § 5.11), your request is
deemed to constitute an agreement to pay any fees that may be chargeable up to $25.00. Fees may be
charged for searching for records sought at the respective clerical, professional, and/or managerial rates of
$4.00/$7.00/$10.25 per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.10 per copy. The first
100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and the remaining combined charges for search
and duplication must exceed $14.00 before we will charge you any fees. Most requests do not require any
fees; however, if fees in excess of $25.00 are required, we will notify you beforehand.
Personally Identifiable Information
USCIS no longer collects Social Security Numbers in connection with FOIA or PA requests. When
forwarding to us any documents related to your request, please ensure any Social Security Numbers on
the documents are blanked out or removed.
The National Records Center (NRC) has the responsibility to ensure that personally identifiable

information (PII) pertaining to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clients is protected. In
our efforts to safeguard this information, we may request that additional information be provided to
facilitate and correctly identify records responsive to your request. Though submission of this information
is voluntary, without this information, your request may be delayed while additional steps are taken to
ensure the correct responsive records are located and processed. Further, if we are unable to positively
identify the subject of the record we may be unable to provide records responsive to your FOIA request.
