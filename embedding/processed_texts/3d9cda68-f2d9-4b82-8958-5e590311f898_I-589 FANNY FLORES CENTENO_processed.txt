and correct.  Title 18, United States Code, Section 1546(a), provides in part: Whoever knowingly makes under oath, or as permitted under penalty of
perjury under Section 1746 of Title 28, United States Code, knowingly subscribes as true, any false statement with respect to a material fact in any
application, affidavit, or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder, or knowingly presents any such
application, affidavit, or other document containing any such false statement or which fails to contain any reasonable basis in law or fact - shall be
fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned for up to 25 years.  I certify that I am physically present in the United States or seeking admission at
a Port of Entry when I execute this application.  I authorize the release of any information from my immigration record that U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) needs to determine eligibility for the benefit I am seeking.
WARNING:   Applicants who are in the United States unlawfully  are subject to removal if their asylum or withholding claims are not
granted by an asylum officer or an immigration judge.  Any information provided in completing this application may be used as a basis for
the institution of, or as evidence in, removal proceedings even if the application is later withdrawn.  Applicants determined to have
knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum will be permanently ineligible for any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality
Act.  You may not avoid a frivolous finding simply because someone advised you to provide false information in your asylum application.  If
filing with USCIS, unexcused failure to appear for an appointment to provide biometrics (such as fingerprints) and your biographical
information within the time allowed may result in an asylum officer dismissing your asylum application or referring it to an immigration
judge.  Failure without good cause to provide DHS with biometrics or other biographical information while in removal proceedings may
result in your application being found abandoned by the immigration judge.  See sections 208(d)(5)(A) and 208(d)(6) of the INA and 8 CFR
sections 208.10, 1208.10, 208.20, 1003.47(d) and 1208.20.
