Please note that, by signing this Form I-864, you agree to assume certain specific obligations under the Immigration and Nationality
Act (INA) and other Federal laws.  The following paragraphs describe those obligations.  Please read the following information
carefully before you sign Form I-864.  If you do not understand the obligations, you may wish to consult an attorney or accredited
What is the Legal Effect of My Signing Form I-864?
Under this contract, you agree that, in deciding whether the intending immigrant can establish that he or she is not inadmissible to the
United States as a person likely to become a public charge, the U.S. Government can consider your income and assets as available for
the support of the intending immigrant.
What If I Choose Not to Sign Form I-864?
What Does Signing Form I-864 Require Me To Do?
If an intending immigrant becomes a lawful permanent resident in the United States based on a Form I-864 that you have signed, then,
until your obligations under Form I-864 terminate, you must:

NOTE:   Read the Penalties section of the Form I-864 Instructions before completing this part.
If you sign Form I-864 on behalf of any person (called the intending immigrant) who is applying for an immigrant visa or for
adjustment of status to a lawful permanent resident, and that intending immigrant submits Form I-864 to the U.S. Government with his
or her application for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status, under INA section 213A, these actions create a contract between you
and the U.S. Government.  The intending immigrant becoming a lawful permanent resident is the consideration for the contract.
The U.S. Government cannot make you sign Form 1-864 if you do not want to do so.  But if you do not sign Form I-864, the intending
immigrant may not become a lawful permanent resident in the United States.10.

What Other Consequences Are There?Part 8.  Sponsor's Contract, Contact Information, Certification, and Signature ( continued )
If an intending immigrant becomes a lawful permanent resident in the United States based on a Form I-864 that you have signed, then,
until your obligations under Form I-864 terminate, the U.S. Government may consider (deem) your income and assets as available to
that person, in determining whether he or she is eligible for certain Federal means-tested public benefits and also for state or local
means-tested public benefits, if the state or local government's rules provide for consideration (deeming) of your income and assets as
available to the person.
This provision does not apply to public benefits specified in section 403(c) of the Welfare Reform Act such as emergency Medicaid,
short-term, non-cash emergency relief; services provided under the National School Lunch and Child Nutrition Acts; immunizations
and testing and treatment for communicable diseases; and means-tested programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
What If I Do Not Fulfill My Obligations?
If you do not provide sufficient support to the person who becomes a lawful permanent resident based on a Form I-864 that you
signed, that person may sue you for this support.
If a Federal, state, local, or private agency provided any covered means-tested public benefit to the person who becomes a lawful
permanent resident based on a Form I-864 that you signed, the agency may ask you to reimburse them for the amount of the benefits
they provided.  If you do not make the reimbursement, the agency may sue you for the amount that the agency believes you owe.
If you are sued, and the court enters a judgment against you, the person or agency that sued you may use any legally permitted
procedures for enforcing or collecting the judgment.  You may also be required to pay the costs of collection, including attorney fees.
When Will These Obligations End?
NOTE:   Divorce does not  terminate your obligations under Form I-864.
Your obligations under a Form I-864 that you signed also end if you die.  Therefore, if you die, your estate is not required to take
responsibility for the person's support after your death.  However, your estate may owe any support that you accumulated before you
Form I-864   Edition   10/17/24If you do not file a properly completed Form I-865 within 30 days of any change of address, USCIS may impose a civil fine for your
