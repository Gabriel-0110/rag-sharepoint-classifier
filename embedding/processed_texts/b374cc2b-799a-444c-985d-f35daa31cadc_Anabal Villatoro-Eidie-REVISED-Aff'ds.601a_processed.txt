1 AFFIDAVIT of ANIBAL VILLATORO PEREZ USC Petitioner for Son: Eidie Villatoro for I-601A 1182 West Farm Road, No. 33, Bronx, New York 10459  My name is Anibal Perez. I am the Petitioner for the I-601A Provisional Waiver of Unlawful Presence for my older son: Eidie Villatoro. I have been in the US for more than 40 years. I became an American citizen in 2007. I am very proud of that accomplishment. Because I am a legal US-citizen I can legally petition for my son to stay in the US with me.  I was born in San Marcos, Guatemala 65 years ago. So was my son, and my other four children. Both my two sons immigrated to the US. One year apart. My older son Eidie came in 2009. I filed the I-130 in 2011 for him to establish he is my non-citizen relative. Now I am making this I-601A petition on his behalf so he can stay with me in the United States. I wanted him to wait to immigrate lawfully but it was taking so many years and Eidie wanted to live with me and know me before I got too old and too sick; I had been gone from him for so long, since he was nine years old. He barely remembered me, but he wanted to have a relationship with his father while he still could.  I told their mother when I had to leave Guatemala that she should always tell the children that I left so I could take better care of them by sending money from the US. I did that; I sent remittances every month to make sure my children ate well and could go to school. But that is not the whole truth of why I immigrated to the US in 1990, without my five little children and wife I dearly loved.  You see, I was a policeman in Guatemala City. The government then—and now still—and law enforcement was corrupt. Military authorities were running the country and we police were told if we did not obey their orders—their orders to collect dishonest fees for honest businesses, to shoot people who did not agree or be shot ourselves—harm would come to us and our families. I had to flee. If I was dead, I could not provide. If I stayed, I would be shot. If I went to the US, I could earn money and send it to my family. So, I immigrated to the US.
2 I got good work in the US and have worked in sales for 30 years now. But the pandemic hit, and I have had no work for a year. My son takes care of me. He is my best friend and my caretaker. I never really had a chance to take care of him physically or emotionally. All I could do was provide financially. But now the tables have turned, and the son takes care of the father.  Eidie earns a good living. He is an auto mechanic and is very good at it. He takes care of our food and rent, takes me to my doctor appointments and gets my meds. He makes sure he is there to support me and keep me from getting too depressed when I think about him being sent away from the US and back to Guatemala.  No man should ever have to lose a child, or even face such a thought. If my son had to be sent back to Guatemala, I feel like I would turn into a 100-year-old man overnight, from the 65-year-old-man I am today. Really, my life would not be worth anything anymore, without my son. We do not want to be apart, so if Eidie’s petition is denied, we would both have go together back to Guatemala—something neither of us wants to do, ever.  That is a depressing thought. Crime is everywhere in Guatemala; I am sure it is even worse than when I was a policeman there. We would be poor. What jobs would there be for an old man? What jobs could Eidie get that would let him have good life and a safe future?  Please do not separate my son from me. Please grant his I-601A petition. I need him. And he needs me. We both pay our taxes, and we both appreciate how blessed we are to live in the United States of America. Thank you for keeping my family together.  Respectfully submitted,    _______________________________   Anibal Perez Petitioner
3 AFFIDAVIT of EIDIE VILLATORO  Applicant for I-601A 1182 West Farm Road, No. 33, Bronx, New York 10459  I am one of five children of my Petitioner and father: Anibal Villatoro Perez.   My father filed the I-601A Waiver of Unlawful Presence on my behalf. I want to stay in the United States with my father. I take care of him now, the way he used to take care of me when he lived with the family when all of us were children in Guatemala. He took care of us from far away too, when he went to the US, and sent money so we would have food and shelter. He is a good man and a good father.  My father had to flee from Guatemala to save his own life. The police force was corrupt, and he was threatened with death. And his family was threatened with harm if he did not obey orders from military authorities—orders that were dishonest and involved paybacks and even murder. He risked his life walking to the US—the way I did—but he knew that if he survived, he would be able to take care of the family back in Guatemala.   As soon as he became a US citizen in 2007, he tried to petition for me to come join him. But you know how slow bureaucracy is. I was a man by then, trying to earn a living and take care of myself and the family still in Guatemala. But there were no jobs, and I was afraid I would be killed too. So, I immigrated to the US and, I admit, I came without inspection and risked getting picked up and sent back. But I made it. I immigrated in 2009. My brother came a year after me. Now we both live together with our father. I take care of my father now. I pay all the bills and take care of the household. I have a good job as an auto mechanic so I make a good living.   But my father is so depressed and afraid I might be deported to Guatemala that he is very sad and morose. He cannot eat unless I urge him to. He does not want to do anything. I have to keep him present in the world. Plus, he lost his job in sales that he loved and was really good at. Once COVID closed everything down, he could not make sales calls or see any of his customers—and their businesses closed down too. Both of us were afraid of getting the virus, so we hunkered
4 down for months. I’ve been able to work, though, because even during lockdown, people need to drive and have cars that work. But my father could not go to work. And that made him even more depressed. I am now very worried that he might do something drastic and harm himself, or worse, when he says that life is not worth living and it will all be hopeless if I am gone from his life. It will be hopeless for me if he is gone from my life.  We were apart for so long we are making up for lost time. We have built a strong father-son bond in the past decade I have been here with my father. Of course, he is regretful he missed out on my growing up but I could feel his influence and promised him I would do good. I have tried to do good ever since I was a young boy. I work hard. Here in the US, I pay my taxes and try to help our neighborhood.   I want to become a legal resident too. Or, better yet, I want to become citizen like my father. Then he and I will be the all-American family. What a goal that would be. But first, I ask that you consider my personal plea, on behalf of my father and me, to grant my petition to stay in the US so I can take care of my father. He needs me for everything, and, in the US, I will be able to provide him with everything he needs. But most important, if my father and me can stay together, I will provide him with a family again. With a life worth living.  Thank you for your consideration of our family.  Respectfully submitted,    ______________________________________   Eidie Villatoro    Applicant
