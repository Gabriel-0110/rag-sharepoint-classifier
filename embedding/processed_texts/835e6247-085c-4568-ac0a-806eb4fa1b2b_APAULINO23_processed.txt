otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether pre -existing, present or future), including initial claims, coun ter-claims, cross -
claims and third -party claims, arising from or relating  directly or indirectly  to this Agreement , including the validity, enforceability, interpretation,
scope, or application of the Agreement and this A rbitration Provision (except for the prohibition on class or other non- individual claims, which shall
be for a court to decide)  (“Claim”) shall be decided, upon the election of you or us  (or our agents, employees, successors, representatives, affiliated
companies, or assigns), by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to litigate a claim in court or to have a jury  trial.  Regardless of who
demands arbitration, you shall have the right to select either of the following arbitration organizations to administer the arbitration: the American
Arbitration Association ( (1-800-778-7879; http://www.adr.org ) or Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (1 -800-352-5267;

through you (including a taxpayer  filing  jointly, employee, agent, representative, affiliated company, predecessor or successor, heir, assignee, or
trustee in bankruptcy) against us shall be subject to arbitration as described herein.
13.3. Exceptions : We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate any individual Claim you bring in small claims court or an equivalent court so long as

to the Account  by several parties.
13.4. Individual Claims Only: Claims may be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.  Claims subject to this A rbitration Provision may not
be joined or consolidated in arbitration with any Claim of any other person or be arbitrated on a class basis, in a representative capacity on behalf of

case this A rbitration Provision shall govern.  Any i n-person arbitration hearing for a Claim shall take place within the federal judicial district in which
you live or at such other reasonably convenient location as agreed by the parties.  The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent wi th
the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) and shall honor all claims of privilege and confidentiality rec ognized at law.  All statutes of
limitations that would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding.

Amount paid directly to you5                 $_______________
If you apply for and receive one or more  tax refund advance s from a third party refund advance provider  in 2024, the above amount paid
directly to you will be reduced by the amount of such  refund advance s and accrued interest on those refund advances .
1 This Refund Transfer Fee Disclosure  reflects the amount paid directly to you using the expected federal refund amount and does not
take into account any amount due to you from any state taxing authorities , as that amount is typically not estimable at this time. In the
event  any of  your state tax refund s are disbursed to Bank before the federal tax refund, the above fees will be deducted from that state
refund first, and any balance from subsequent refunds received. See the Subsequent Refunds  section  below for more details.
2 The RT Processing Fee will be retained by Servicer for its refund transfer processing services  and may be shared with the transmitter of
your return  to the IRS  (“Transmitter”) . Servicer shall pay Bank for its banking services.  The RT Processing Fee will be increased by $14.95
if Servicer process es federal and state refund s for you (and an additional $14.95  fee will be incurred for each state  thereafter  if multiple
state returns are processed) .
3 The transmission fee paid to Transmitter may include a technology fee  and an electronic filing fee . A portion of the transmission fee paid
to Transmitter  may be subsequently paid to the tax preparer .
4 You may be charged a $12.00  check administration fee for a cashier’s  check  disbursement option. This fee applies to disbursements of
both federal and state tax refunds and applies to each cashier’s check printed. The Servicer, Transmitter and tax preparer will each receive
a portion of the check administration fee.  Inquire with your tax preparer to determine applicability of this fee.
5 The amount paid directly to you may be less if the IRS does not send us your full refund. If the amount actually paid to you is less tha n
the amount shown above, you can view an updated itemization on our website by logging on to www.sbtpg.com . As discussed in Footnote
1, the  amount shown here does not reflect state tax refund amounts, if any.
Subsequent refund s: Although you may be filing for and receive tax refunds from both the IRS and one or more state tax authorities , the
itemization above only reflects your expected federal tax refund amount , as any refund due from a state taxing authority is typically not
estimable at this time . We will deduct the RT Processing  Fee and the fees indicated above from the first tax refund the Bank receives ,
whether that be federal or state,  and any balance that remains  unpaid will be deducted  from any subsequent  refund s in the order they ALEJANDRA PAULINO

for the purpose of receiving a direct deposit of your  tax refund from the IRS or state tax authority . If and when the tax refund has been
deposited by the IRS or state tax authority  to your Account, Servicer will make all deductions  in the manner  indicated above and disburse the
balance of the Account to you in accordance with the disbursement method chosen by you  in the Agreement . Servicer and Bank have no
control  over and cannot guarantee if or when the IRS or state tax authority  will issue you a refund or what the amount of your expected tax
refund will be.  In the event your 2023 federal and/or state refunds are not sufficient to cover the fees or other amounts due for products
or services set forth in th e Agreement, including repayment of and interest  associated with refund advance products (“Outstanding
Amounts”), any Outstanding Amounts may be deducted from refun ds that you may receive up to 30 months after the date of th e Agreement
and process through the Servicer.

preparation, document preparation and electronic filing fees (“Tax Prep  Fees”) in the event i) your Tax Prep Fees  are not fully paid from
