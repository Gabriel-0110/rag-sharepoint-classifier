Subject: Preparation of Your Corporation Tax Return
Dear JUAN FERNANDEZ:
Thank you for selecting ATAX WOODHAVEN NY  to assist JARABACOA BARBER SHOP CORP  with tax
compliance for 2023.  This letter confirms the terms of our engagement with you and the nature and extent of
services we will provide. To assure mutual understanding of our responsibilities, we ask you to read this letter and
confirm the arrangements by signing and returning a copy to us.  You received this letter because we understand
you are the person responsible for the tax matters of the corporation. If that is not correct, please tell us who that
person is so that we can coordinate return preparation work with the right party.
We will prepare your 2023 federal and all state income tax returns you request using information you provide to
us. We will process the returns and provide you with copies for your records.  We may ask for clarification of
some items, but we will not audit or otherwise verify the data you submit.
We expect to perform the following services:
Prepare the federal, state, and local income tax returns with supporting schedules.
Perform a limited amount of bookkeeping and analysis necessary for preparation of the income tax returns.
It is your responsibility to provide information in a timely manner required for preparation of complete and
accurate returns. You should keep all documents, canceled checks and other data that support your reported
income and deductions. They may be necessary to prove accuracy and completeness of the returns to a taxing
authority. You agree to report all your taxable income, partnership interests, sales of assets, and all investment
income from all sources.
Management is responsible for proper recording of transactions in the accounts, safeguarding assets, and for the
substantial accuracy of the financial records. When you sign the return, or the electronic substitute, you declare
that you have examined the return, including all the accompanying schedules and statements, and that they are
true, correct, and complete, to the best of your knowledge and belief.
Our work will not include any procedures to discover defalcations or other irregularities. The only data or analysis
work we will do is that which is necessary for preparation of your income tax returns.
We must use our judgment in resolving questions where the tax law is unclear, or where there may be conflicts
between the taxing authorities' interpretations of the law and other supportable positions. In order to avoid
penalties, we will apply the "more likely than not" reliance standard to resolve such issues. You agree to honor
our decisions regarding the need to make protective disclosures in your returns.
Penalties of as much as $200,000 can be imposed on a corporation for failing to disclose participation in
"reportable transactions," that is, certain arrangements the IRS has identified as potentially abusive. We will insist
that all such transactions be properly disclosed.
The law also imposes penalties when taxpayers understate their tax liability. If you have concerns about such
penalties, please call us.
Your returns may be selected for audit by a taxing authority. Any proposed adjustments are subject to appeal. In
the event of a tax examination, we can arrange to be available to represent you. Such representation will be a
separate engagement for which an engagement letter will be provided to you. Fees and expenses for defending the
returns will be invoiced in accordance with terms we agree on for that engagement. General Firm Responsibilities

expenses for defending client's return(s) will be invoiced in accordance with terms we agree on for that
We will retain copies of records you supplied to us along with our work papers for your engagement for a period

Subject: Preparation of Your Corporation Tax Return
Dear JUAN FERNANDEZ:
Thank you for selecting ATAX WOODHAVEN NY  to assist JARABACOA BARBER SHOP CORP  with tax
compliance for 2022.  This letter confirms the terms of our engagement with you and the nature and extent of
services we will provide. To assure mutual understanding of our responsibilities, we ask you to read this letter and
confirm the arrangements by signing and returning a copy to us.  You received this letter because we understand
you are the person responsible for the tax matters of the corporation. If that is not correct, please tell us who that
person is so that we can coordinate return preparation work with the right party.
We will prepare your 2022 federal and all state income tax returns you request using information you provide to
us. We will process the returns and provide you with copies for your records.  We may ask for clarification of
some items, but we will not audit or otherwise verify the data you submit.
We expect to perform the following services:
Prepare the federal, state, and local income tax returns with supporting schedules.
Perform a limited amount of bookkeeping and analysis necessary for preparation of the income tax returns.
It is your responsibility to provide information in a timely manner required for preparation of complete and
accurate returns. You should keep all documents, canceled checks and other data that support your reported
income and deductions. They may be necessary to prove accuracy and completeness of the returns to a taxing
authority. You agree to report all your taxable income, partnership interests, sales of assets, and all investment
income from all sources.
Management is responsible for proper recording of transactions in the accounts, safeguarding assets, and for the
substantial accuracy of the financial records. When you sign the return, or the electronic substitute, you declare
that you have examined the return, including all the accompanying schedules and statements, and that they are
true, correct, and complete, to the best of your knowledge and belief.
Our work will not include any procedures to discover defalcations or other irregularities. The only data or analysis
work we will do is that which is necessary for preparation of your income tax returns.
We must use our judgment in resolving questions where the tax law is unclear, or where there may be conflicts
between the taxing authorities' interpretations of the law and other supportable positions. In order to avoid
penalties, we will apply the "more likely than not" reliance standard to resolve such issues. You agree to honor
our decisions regarding the need to make protective disclosures in your returns.
Penalties of as much as $200,000 can be imposed on a corporation for failing to disclose participation in
"reportable transactions," that is, certain arrangements the IRS has identified as potentially abusive. We will insist
that all such transactions be properly disclosed.
The law also imposes penalties when taxpayers understate their tax liability. If you have concerns about such
penalties, please call us.
Your returns may be selected for audit by a taxing authority. Any proposed adjustments are subject to appeal. In
the event of a tax examination, we can arrange to be available to represent you. Such representation will be a
separate engagement for which an engagement letter will be provided to you. Fees and expenses for defending the
returns will be invoiced in accordance with terms we agree on for that engagement. General Firm Responsibilities

law, an interest charge may be added to all accounts not paid within thirty (30) days. Any representation fees and
expenses for defending client's return(s) will be invoiced in accordance with terms we agree on for that
We will retain copies of records you supplied to us along with our work papers for your engagement for a period
of seven years. After seven years, our work papers and engagement files may be destroyed. All of your original
records may be returned to you at the end of this engagement. You should keep the original records in secure

Subject: Preparation of Your Corporation Tax Return
Dear JUAN FERNANDEZ:
Thank you for selecting ATAX WOODHAVEN NY  to assist JARABACOA BARBER SHOP CORP  with tax
compliance for 2020.  This letter confirms the terms of our engagement with you and the nature and extent of
services we will provide. To assure mutual understanding of our responsibilities, we ask you to read this letter and
confirm the arrangements by signing and returning a copy to us.  You received this letter because we understand
you are the person responsible for the tax matters of the corporation. If that is not correct, please tell us who that
person is so that we can coordinate return preparation work with the right party.
We will prepare your 2020 federal and all state income tax returns you request using information you provide to
us. We will process the returns and provide you with copies for your records.  We may ask for clarification of
some items, but we will not audit or otherwise verify the data you submit.
We expect to perform the following services:
Prepare the federal, state, and local income tax returns with supporting schedules.
Perform a limited amount of bookkeeping and analysis necessary for preparation of the income tax returns.
It is your responsibility to provide information in a timely manner required for preparation of complete and
accurate returns. You should keep all documents, canceled checks and other data that support your reported
income and deductions. They may be necessary to prove accuracy and completeness of the returns to a taxing
authority. You agree to report all your taxable income, partnership interests, sales of assets, and all investment
income from all sources.
Management is responsible for proper recording of transactions in the accounts, safeguarding assets, and for the
substantial accuracy of the financial records. When you sign the return, or the electronic substitute, you declare
that you have examined the return, including all the accompanying schedules and statements, and that they are
true, correct, and complete, to the best of your knowledge and belief.
Our work will not include any procedures to discover defalcations or other irregularities. The only data or analysis
work we will do is that which is necessary for preparation of your income tax returns.
We must use our judgment in resolving questions where the tax law is unclear, or where there may be conflicts
between the taxing authorities' interpretations of the law and other supportable positions. In order to avoid
penalties, we will apply the "more likely than not" reliance standard to resolve such issues. You agree to honor
our decisions regarding the need to make protective disclosures in your returns.
Penalties of as much as $200,000 can be imposed on a corporation for failing to disclose participation in
"reportable transactions," that is, certain arrangements the IRS has identified as potentially abusive. We will insist
that all such transactions be properly disclosed.
The law also imposes penalties when taxpayers understate their tax liability. If you have concerns about such
penalties, please call us.
Your returns may be selected for audit by a taxing authority. Any proposed adjustments are subject to appeal. In
the event of a tax examination, we can arrange to be available to represent you. Such representation will be a
separate engagement for which an engagement letter will be provided to you. Fees and expenses for defending the
returns will be invoiced in accordance with terms we agree on for that engagement. General Firm Responsibilities

Client Substantiation Requirements
Conflicts of Interest, Due Diligence and Favorable Interpretation1120 - CORPORATION TAX RETURN ENGAGEMENT LETTER

plus out-of-pocket expenses. All invoices are due and payable upon presentation. To the extent permitted by state
law, an interest charge may be added to all accounts not paid within thirty (30) days. Any representation fees and
expenses for defending client's return(s) will be invoiced in accordance with terms we agree on for that
We will retain copies of records you supplied to us along with our work papers for your engagement for a period
of seven years. After seven years, our work papers and engagement files may be destroyed. All of your original
records may be returned to you at the end of this engagement. You should keep the original records in secure
