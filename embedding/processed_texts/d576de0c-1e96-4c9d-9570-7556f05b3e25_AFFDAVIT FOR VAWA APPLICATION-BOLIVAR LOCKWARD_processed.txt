AFFIDAVIT OF APPLICANT BOLIVAR LOCKWARD CASTILLO
I, Bolivar Lockward Castillo , solemnly affirm to the be st of my knowledge and ability that the
following is the truth under the penalties of perjury:
1. I am a native and citizen of Santiago, Dominican Republic , born August 10, 1983. I last
came to the United States on March 22, 2021, with a B2 visitor visa .
2. I currently reside 2366 Grand Concourse, Apt. 3AA, Bronx, NY 10458 and have resided
there since February 2 , 2022.
3. I am currently filing this VAWA application due to the extensive psychological and
emotional abuse I have suffered at the hands of my wife, Lor na Isier Martinez Oquendo .
4. Lorna and I got married on December 3, 2021 in New York. We met in January 2021 when
I had come to vacation here . I met her through a friend and there was an immediate
5. Lorna and I moved in together on June 1, 2021. We lived at 211 West 145th Street, Apt.
2EE, New York, NY 10039. We lived there together until the day she kicked me out of the house in February of this year.
6. When I first met Lorna, we immediately had a beautiful connection . When I came to
vacation in January of 2021, I had no idea I’d meet such a beautiful woman. Before my
vacation finished, I gave her my number so that we could keep getting to know each other
and keep talking. On M arch 22, 2021, I came into the United States again to visit my sister
in Miami. At that point me and Lorna had been talking to each other almost everyday and
our bond was becoming very strong. Lorna had told me that she was going to be in Miami
at the same time as me and wanted to meet up and spend time together.
7. After spending the day together in Miami our relationship developed and grew very strong .
During my stay she introduced me to her friends and made me a priority in her life. She
ultimately convinc ed me to not go back and to stay with her and pursue our relationship.
8. Our relationship progressed fast but only because of how in love we were. We moved in
together in June of 2021, got engaged in October of 2021, and married in December 2021.
After we g ot engaged Lorna started to change, but I figured it was only because she was
nervous about getting married so soon. I was wrong and after we got married her actions
towards me only got worse.
9. After getting engaged Lorna started to become verbally aggress ive and started insulting me
on various occasions . Anytime I tried to confront her about the way she spoke to me, she
would just completely stop speaking to me. Then after we got married,  she started
controlling me through money.
10. Lorna would always demand that I give her money for her expenses and if I  didn’t comply
then she would stop talking to me and force me to sleep on the couch until I gave her what she wanted . She even gave me orders of how to spend any money. She forbade me from
sending money to my mother in Dominican Republic telling me that “s he [Lorna] was my
only priority now .”
11. Whenever we would get into disagreements,  I would try to speak to her with kindness and
understanding, but she would always yell at me, insult me,  and threaten to have me arrested
and deported by faking injuries to he rself and filing domestic abuse charges. I felt trapped
and manipulated by her . In January of 2022 I went to Florida to visit my half -sister because
her father had just passed away. The trip was very important to me because I was terrified of the emotional  toll my sister was going through with this loss. Lorna told me that “I
shouldn’t be spending so much money on a trip for someone who is already dead.” It felt
terrible to hear that from her. When I did go on the trip, I ended up having to go to the
hospit al because I suffered from a complete panic attack where I vomited frequently and
had trouble breathing due to the psychological stress Lorna was causing me for having taken the trip in the first place. When Lorna found out, she made no effort to come see me.
Instead, a few days later she had her friend message me telling me Lorna had suffered from
an epileptic seizure. I ended up ending my trip and rushing home to comfort her and see
her. It turned out to be completely fake and made up. She made me feel ve ry worthless and
12. Lorna has called me an idiot on numerous occasions and emotionally abused me. It has gotten to the point where I had to see a psychologist to help with my deteriorating mental
health. The psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD a nd Major Depression. I still have
nightmares of the things she would say and do to manipulate and hurt me. I have developed severe trust issues and don’t even want to have any romantic relationship with anyone else
due to the trauma she has caused me.
13. I am writing this affidavit because of the extensive abuse I suffered from Lorna and I do
not want it to continue in any way.
