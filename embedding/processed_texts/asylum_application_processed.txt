ASYLUM APPLICATION SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS
Applicant: Ahmed Hassan
A-Number: A123456789
Country of Origin: Syria
PERSECUTION EVIDENCE PACKAGE
1. COUNTRY CONDITIONS EVIDENCE
This package contains evidence of the ongoing civil war and persecution in Syria, specifically targeting individuals of my ethnic and religious background.
2. PERSONAL TESTIMONY
I fled Syria in 2019 after receiving direct threats from militia groups due to my work as a journalist reporting on human rights violations.
3. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
- News articles about persecution of journalists in Syria
- Medical records from treatment received after physical assault
- Witness statements from colleagues who can verify the threats
- Death certificate of my brother who was killed for similar activities
4. EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY
Dr. Helen Roberts, Middle East expert at Georgetown University, has provided an affidavit regarding the credibility of my claims and the dangerous conditions for journalists in Syria.
5. PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION
Dr. James Thompson has diagnosed me with PTSD resulting from the persecution and trauma experienced in Syria.
I respectfully request that the Immigration Court grant me asylum in the United States based on the well-founded fear of persecution that I would face if returned to Syria.
The evidence clearly demonstrates that I am a member of a particular social group (journalists) that is specifically targeted by government and militia forces in Syria.
