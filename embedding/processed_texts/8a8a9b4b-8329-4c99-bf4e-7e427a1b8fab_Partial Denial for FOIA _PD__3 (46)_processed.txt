Dear ALEXANDER ARANDIA:
This letter is in response to your request for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or
Privacy Act (PA), which was received in this office on February 11, 2025, regarding ANA MORAN
We have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and have applied the
FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General’s guidance.  We have completed the
review of all documents and have identified 99 pages that are responsive to your request. Enclosed are 85
pages released in their entirety and 9 pages released in part. We are withholding 5 pages in full. In our
review of these pages, we have determined they contain no reasonably segregable portion(s) of non-
exempt information.  We have reviewed and have determined to release all information except those
portions that are exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(6) and (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA.
The following exemptions are applicable:
Exemption (b)(6) permits the government to withhold all information about individuals in personnel,
medical and similar files where the disclosure of such information would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may
consist of birth certificates, naturalization certificates, drivers’ licenses, social security numbers, home
addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are
considered personal.
Exemption (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA provides protection for records or information for law enforcement
purposes which would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or
prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such
disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  The types of documents and/or
information we have withheld could consist of law enforcement systems checks, manuals, checkpoint
locations, surveillance techniques, and various other documents.
There may be additional documents that contain discretionary releases of exempt information. If made,
these releases are specifically identified in the responsive record. These discretionary releases do not
waive our ability to invoke applicable FOIA exemptions for similar or related information in the future.
The enclosed record consists of the best reproducible copies available. Certain pages contain marks that
appear to be blacked-out information. The black marks were made prior to our receipt of the file and are
not information we have withheld under the provisions of the FOIA or PA.
You have the right to file an administrative appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter. By filing an
appeal, you preserve your rights under FOIA and give the agency a chance to review and reconsider your
request and the agency’s decision. You may file an administrative FOIA appeal electronically to USCIS
through your online portal by selecting Appeal in the Actions drop down window.  You may also file an

administrative FOIA appeal to USCIS at: USCIS FOIA/PA Appeals Office, 150 Space Center Loop, Suite
500, Lee's Summit, MO 64064-2139. Both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked “Freedom
of Information Act Appeal.”
If you would like to discuss our response before filing an appeal to attempt to resolve your dispute
without going through the appeals process, you may contact our USCIS FOIA Public Liaison at U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services, National Records Center, FOIA/PA Office, P.O. Box 648010,
