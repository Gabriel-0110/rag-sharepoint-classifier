Introduction and Significant Vulnerabilities: 1
The purpose of this psychological evaluation is to assess Anibal Villatoro's (here
forward called "Anibal") psycho-emotional profile. Also explored are the potential psycho­
emotional effects, extreme psychological hardship, and other negative consequences in the
event Eidie 0. Villatoro Barrios (here forward called "Eidie") (Son) is not granted a hardship
psychologically deteriorate if he were to experience another trauma in life, such as the possible
prolonged separation from his son.
Furthermore, in light of Anibal's age, he is at an increased risk of developing further
psychiatric conditions, and of his overall conditions worsening. According to the World
Health Organization:
"Multiple social, psychological, and biological factors determine the level of
mental health of a person at any point of time. As well as the typical life
stressors common to all people, many older adults lose their ability to live
independently because of limited mobility, chronic pain, frailty or other mental
or physical problems, and require some form of long-term care. In addition,
older people are more likely to experience events such as bereavement,
a drop in socioeconomic status with retirement, or a disability. All of
these factors can result in isolation, loss of independence, loneliness and
psychological distress in older people.
Mental health has an impact on physical health and vice versa. For example,
older adults with physical health conditions such as heart disease have higher
rates of depression than those who are medically well. Conversely, untreated
depression in an older person with heart disease can negatively affect the
outcome of the physical disease."
The stress the family has been experiencing due to the possibility of separating from
Eidie, or of having to relocate to Guatemala to be with him, and the previously described
events and stressors are causing Anibal to experience a great deal of anxiety and despair, which
can be detrimental to his psychological, and medical health. The culminating effects of this
entire scenario described here could result in the developing of long-lasting traumatic
experiences for this family. Neuroscience research indicates that the brain's ability to learn and
respond appropriately to stress can negatively be impacted by traumatic events, leading to an
increased likelihood of mental illness and other negative sequelae throughout the lifespan.
Research further points to the function of Cortisol (a hormone involved in stress regulation)
showing how during stressful situations the brain releases high amounts of this chemical. In
high amounts, Cortisol can be potentially toxic to the body. Depending on the severity and
chronicity of the stressful event(s), it can result in biological vulnerabilities and inhibit the
growth of healthy neural networks. Such an overstimulation of the brain from traumatic stress
is believed to impact on regions of the brain that are most vulnerable to trauma early in life,
although adults like Anibal, undergoing prolonged stress and trauma (such as, but not limited
to, the anticipation of a possible prolonged separation) are vulnerable to this type of damage
as well.
Mental Status Examination:
Based on test data and clinical impressions, Anibal's intelligence is estimated to be
within the average range. He was able to solve some problems measuring factual knowledge
of persons, places, and common phenomena. When asked to name the last three U.S.
Presidents, he responded, "Trump, Obama, and Clinton." He was able to solve problems that
required abstract reasoning. For example, when asked "In what way are a piano and a guitar
