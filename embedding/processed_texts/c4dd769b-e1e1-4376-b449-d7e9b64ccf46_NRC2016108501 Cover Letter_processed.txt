Dear Leon J. Quintero:  This is in response to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request received in this
office August 26, 2016 regarding Heriberto Alfredo Del Rio.
We have completed the review of all documents and have identified 3 pages that are responsive to your
request.  Enclosed are 1 page released in its entirety and 1 page released in part .  We have reviewed and
have determined to release all information except th ose portions that are exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §
552 (b)(7)(E) of the FOIA.
During our review, USCIS located 1 page of potentia lly responsive document that may have originated
from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (IC E). USCIS has sent the document(s) and a copy of
your FOIA request to the ICE FOIA Office for consider ation and direct response to you. Should you wish
to contact ICE concerning the status of the processi ng of the document(s), please contact the ICE FOIA

Exemption (b)(7)(E) provides protection for records or information for law enforcement purposes which
would disclose techniques and procedures for law enfo rcement investigations or prosecutions, or would
disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or  prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably
be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  The types of documents and/or information we have
withheld could consist of law en forcement systems checks, manuals, checkpoint locations, surveillance
techniques, and various other documents.    As a result of discussion between agency personnel and a member of our staff, as a matter of
administrative discretion, we are releasing comput er codes found on system screen prints previously
withheld under exemption b(2). There may be additiona l documents that contain discretionary releases of
exempt information.  We will identify discretionary  releases within the reco rd.  These discretionary
releases do not waive our ability to invoke applicable FOIA exemptions for similar or related information
in the future.
The enclosed record consists of the best reproducible  copies available.  Certain pages may contain marks
that appear to be blacked-out information. Such bl ack marks would have been present prior to our receipt
of the file and are not information we have w ithheld under the provisions of the FOIA or PA.
